# Market Basket Analysis - Pharmacy Store Data

## Introduction and Goal:

Welcome to the Market Basket Analysis project on sales transactions of a pharmacy store. The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into customer behavior and identify opportunities for improving sales and marketing strategies. By understanding associations and identifying items frequently bought together, we aim to enhance customer experience, manage inventory efficiently, and optimize marketing strategy.

## Data Details:

The dataset used in this analysis is raw transactional data directly obtained from a pharmacy store. It comprises transactional records spanning from July 2022 to April 2023, with each row representing an item sold. This rich dataset provides valuable insights into customer purchasing patterns and preferences.

## Analysis:

Market basket analysis is a powerful technique used to uncover associations between items purchased by customers. We employ concepts such as support, confidence, and lift to identify item associations and patterns within the dataset. Through this analysis, we aim to understand customer purchasing behavior and uncover meaningful relationships among products.

## Highlights:

### 1. Huge Raw Data:
The dataset contains a significant volume of raw transactional data, presenting both challenges and opportunities for data extraction, manipulation and analysis.
### 2. Utilizing Market Basket Analysis:
